Display operation:

the Neztion display comunicates with the Serial interface assigned in configs.h, this Serial port runs
at the specified speed (default 9600 baud) but in the program.s file in the Neztion editor has beenchanged to 115200 as this:

baud=115200
(all other arameters rrmains the same)

as for the HMI implementaiton all the visual readouts and controls are in the Page0, all values except for 
heater power are text elements who's content can be accessed with command 

objname.txt=\"xxx\", note the scaped quotes.

for the heater output readout is a Progress Bar item, whos coloring is controller by the filling percentage as 

objname.val=x where x is a text of 0 to 100

for temperature input, pressing the h_set text invokes the modified keybdB page. 
this page has been modified so that the OK butrton sends the entered value, heater is is parsed as the 
id of the object that invoked the page.

the OK buttonOn Releave Event contains this code:

if(loadcmpid.val==2||loadcmpid.val==6)
{
  //tip 0
  prints "0:set_t:",0
  prints input.txt,0
  printh ff ff ff
}else if(loadcmpid.val==15||loadcmpid.val==17)
{
  //tip 1-2
  prints "1:set_t:",0
  prints input.txt,0
  printh ff ff ff
  prints "2:set_t:",0
  prints input.txt,0
  printh ff ff ff
}else if(loadcmpid.val==10||loadcmpid.val==12)
{
  //tip3
  prints "3:set_t:",0
  prints input.txt,0
  printh ff ff ff
}
//return to origin page
page loadpageid.val

as the keyboard is displayerd, none of the fields normally updated hy the station hmi_update function passed in the constructor
can be accessed. so when the main page call the Page Exit Event it sends an internal command as "xxxP", where xxx is te preamble to parse
an internal command and P halts any update going to the display. as the keyboard loads the mainpage on exit the Positionalize Event is called
and the command "xxxR" is sent, this resumes all the updates

temirnation:
every command received by the station from the display is rerminated with three bytes like xFF, XFF, xFF. this is because i was
not able to send any usual temrinator like \n si i stuck with the default Nextion style temrinator.

interpretation:
all comamnds received by the station is parsed the same way being from display or usb, note that the display trins the terminator. 
every command is arsed by the Serial_control.h file content and is based on the comamnd table in configs.h
