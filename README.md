This is the answare to my quest for a cheap JBC soldering station, it is still not a super cheap solution but a good compromise to the outstanding andpeice performance and the overpriced sations.

Features:
-touch HMI powered by a Nextion display (check HMI folder)
-threee four indipendent output drivers configured for driving two single tip handpeices and one dual heater (AM120)
-vacuum pump support for desoldering tips, note the selected pump has dual head for an SMD hand picker
- full heater power driving capability
- efficent output driver with mpsfet SSR
- full foftware configurator for thermocouple and PID calcibration

Disclamer:
This project has been designed by an amateut, some design mistaked might be present and improvements are certanly possible. absolutely under no ciorcumstances is any liability acknoowledged by the publicher
